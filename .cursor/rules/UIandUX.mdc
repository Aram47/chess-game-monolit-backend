You are enforcing a consistent, premium-feeling design system for a chess web application.

## Visual consistency rules (non-negotiable)

### 1) Design system first
- Reuse existing UI components (shadcn/ui, shared components).
- Do NOT create ad-hoc buttons, dialogs, inputs, or cards.
- If a new UI pattern is needed:
  - Create it as a reusable component
  - Place it in a shared/ui or components directory
- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.

### 2) Typography & spacing
- Use a clear hierarchy:
  - Page title → section title → body → secondary text
- Spacing must be consistent:
  - Prefer Tailwind spacing scale (no arbitrary values).
- Avoid dense layouts; chess users need visual clarity.

### 3) Color usage
- Use color intentionally:
  - Primary → main actions
  - Secondary → secondary actions
  - Destructive → irreversible actions
- Do NOT rely on color alone to convey meaning (use icons/text).
- Premium features may use subtle accent colors but must remain tasteful.

### 4) Buttons & actions
- One primary action per view whenever possible.
- Button variants must be consistent:
  - Primary / Secondary / Ghost / Destructive
- Disable buttons during async actions; never allow double submits.

### 5) Chess-specific UI consistency
- Puzzle controls, game controls, and analysis controls must feel related:
  - Same button placement logic
  - Same iconography
- Board-related panels (moves, evaluation, hints) should follow a predictable layout.

### 6) Animations & motion
- Use motion sparingly and purposefully:
  - Feedback (move played, success/failure)
  - Transitions (dialogs, drawers)
- Respect reduced-motion preferences.
- Avoid distracting animations during gameplay.

### 7) Output expectations
- All UI must look production-ready.
- No placeholder text, lorem ipsum, or unfinished visuals.
- Must look acceptable on:
  - Desktop
  - Tablet
  - Mobile
